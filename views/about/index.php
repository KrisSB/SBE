		The Shadowbane Emulator project is simple in it's goals: To reverse engineer and create new server software for the now shutdown Massively Multiplayer PvP Role Playing Game Shadowbane.
	    The road to accomplishing that seemingly simplistic goal has been an amazing and difficult one so far. The staff here at SBEmu is dedicated beyond measure and success is nearly guaranteed. As the road draws on and we diligently follow it, we are making friends, building a community and creating some seriously awesome software.
	    The SBEmu team invites you to drop by frequently to see how things are going and to provide any input and/or ideas you may have. We are all here to Play to Crush.
